### __Educational Projects__

#### [__MNIST Neural Network Digit Recognizer__](https://github.com/Leptons1618/MNIST-Neural-Network-digit-recognizer), [August 2023]

In this 'MNIST Neural Network Digit Recognizer' project, I explore a variety of neural network architectures and optimization algorithms to accurately identify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. We begin with a basic two-layer neural network, gradually advancing to a more complex Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), and even delve into Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs). Additionally, we briefly touch upon Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as an alternative approach. Throughout, I fine-tune models using the MNIST dataset and cover both forward and backward propagation techniques. The project offers a comprehensive journey into digit recognition and machine learning.
